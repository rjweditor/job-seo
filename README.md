# Job Listing SEO Keyword Analysis Script

This Python script analyzes a text file to find the most common SEO words, bigrams, and trigrams. It excludes stop words, non-alphabetic words, and provides the results in a file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (`main.py`).
2. Paste job listing text into text file (`joblisting.txt`) .
3. Open a terminal in the script's directory.

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will generate a file named `job_listing_seo.txt` with the top SEO words, bigrams, and trigrams.

## Customization

- Adjust the `top_n` parameter in the script to change the number of most common words, bigrams, and trigrams to display.
- Modify the `file_path` variable to point to your specific text file.

## Dependencies

- nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for tokenization and stop words.
